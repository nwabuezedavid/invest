                    <h2>Frequently ask questions</h2>
                    <p>You might still be wondering what makes bitcoin such a valuable asset although it’s intangible? [Dramatic pause] It’s all about utility – a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) and the blockchain behind it (the platform it runs on) performs a certain task that helps users exchange a form of value, without the middleman. Bitcoin, for example, helps people send money to each other.</p>
                    <p> Basically, you can buy Bitcoin for one of those reasons – you either want to invest in it or you want to trade money. And now comes the question you’ve been thinking about – how do you buy Bitcoin in the first place? </p>
